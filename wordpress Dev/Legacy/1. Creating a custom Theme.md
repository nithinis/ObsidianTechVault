1. Right click on the site in Local and choose "Go To Site"![[Pasted image 20230918181739.png]]
2. Navigate to \<site Folder\>\\app\\public\\wp-content\\themes
3. Create a new folder with the name of the theme.
4. Inside the new theme folder create "index.php". Wordpress uses "index.php" as the default file if no overrides for specific folders are present (more on that later).
5. Also add "style.css". Wordpress uses this style.css to get information about the template to display in the wpAdmin > Appearance > themes section.
6.  Add "screenshot.png" in the same folder for the theme thumbnail. 1200px X 900px ideally.
