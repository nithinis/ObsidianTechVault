2. To iterate over posts, use the "have_posts" while posts and "the_post" method within the while block.
	- `while(have_posts())` will create a while loop that iterates while there are still posts in the array
	- `the_post()` method sets certain built in php variables and functions with the value of the current post within the while loop
