1. Add PHP code within 
```php
<?php
function myFunction(){
echo "Hello this is my first function";
}

myFunction();
?>
```

2. There are built in PHP methods to provide site information

# PHP Functions
|tag|function Name| functionality|
|---|---|---|
||`blogInfo(<dataVariableName>)`| get specific site related data. Most of this data can be found in the wp setting pages.|
||`have_posts()`|To use as while loop argument to iterate over allposts|
||`the_post()`|To use within while loop to set Wordpress post related variables to the current post|
||`the_title()`, `the_content()`, etc | Post specific methods to be used after calling `the_post()`|
||`get_header()`, `get_footer()`| Built in PHP methods to fetch Header.php and Footer.php|
||`wp_head()`| Allows WP to be in control of head section |
|#add_action|`add_action( string $hook_name, `<br>`callable $callback, int $priority = 10, `<br>`int $accepted_args = 1 ):true`| Adds a callback function to an action hook.<br>Actions are the hooks that the WordPress core launches at specific points during execution, or when specific events occur. Plugins can specify that one or more of its PHP functions are executed at these points, using the Action API.<br>[add_action WP reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_action/)|
|#do_action|`do_action( string $hook_name, mixed $arg )`|Calls the callback functions that have been added to an action hook. <brThis function invokes all functions attached to action hook `$hook_name`. <br>It is possible to create new action hooks by simply calling this function, specifying the name of the new hook using the `$hook_name` parameter.<br>You can pass extra arguments to the hooks, much like you can with `apply_filters()`.<br>[do_action() Wordpress Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action/)|



## Understanding `add_action` - `do-action` Methods
Usage:
```
add_action( string $hook_name, callable $callback, int $priority = 10, int $accepted_args = 1 ): true

do_action(string $hook_name, mixed $arg)
```
Here 'hook_name' can be anything. At any point in the code execution, if a corresponding "do_action" with the same hook_name is called, all the callbacks registered using add_action will be executed.

*Arguments to the methods* - add_action accepts variable number of arguments; Make sure "do_action" passes the same number of arguments.

Wordpress has several built in actions already defined. Just search in the code base for "do_actions" to find them and the number of arguments accepted in each.


you can get any of these values
