# Color Selection
In order to maintain appropriate color contrast ratios, choose primary, secondary, and extended colors that support usability by ensuring sufficient color contrast between elements so that people with low vision can see and use the product.

## Color Psychology and Branding
==**TL;DR - Colors can invoke a range of emotions often at opposite end of spectrum. It works in context of the visual and perceived environment.** ==

==**So It is important to supplement colors with words that invoke the desired emotions**==

# Color Palettes
### Primary Palette
The Primary palette comprises of neutrals, white and one bold primary color.
The purpose of a Primary Palette is to bring boldness to our brand and is used in logical ways throughout product and marketing to guide the eye and highlight the important bits.

==**Choose 1 bold primary (for primary actions, buttons, links, etc)**
**Choose 1 neutral primary (for body text, headings)**
**Choose a white for page backgrounds**==

### Secondary Palette
Use the secondary palette colors to soften the experience and to impart confidence and optimism. The secondary palette contains a variety of colors to keep things fresh and interesting. When used in conjunction with the primary palette, these colors make every moment feel on-brand and every interaction informative.

The colors have to be selected intentionally to provide meaningful feedback.

## Extended palette
The extended palette consists of all the useable tints and shades of each color in the palette. These are optional. Keep the variants to 3-5 per Primary/Secondary Color.

## Neutrals
Neutrals have varying degrees of saturation that allow for the appropriate level of warmth across marketing and product. Typically they are used for text and subtle backgrounds when we don't want to draw too much attention to a particular touchpoint or convey information such as "to do" or "disabled". It is good to define 
<u>Dark Neutrals</u>, <u>Mid Neutrals</u> and <u>Light Neutrals</u>, with 2-3 shades of each.

### Dark Neutrals
Dark neutrals are very effective for creating contrast and are therefore the <u>primary color used for typography</u>. They rarely dominate the palette (except for Dark mode, which is discussed later)

### Mid Neutrals
Use mid-neutrals to <u>create depth in components such as modal dialog blankets and cards</u>. Avoid mid-neutrals as background colors because there is usually not enough contrast to remain AA compliant.

### Light neutrals
Use light neutrals as <u>subtle backgrounds to indicate various interactive states such as hover and disabled</u>, or simply to create secondary attention towards a component.
